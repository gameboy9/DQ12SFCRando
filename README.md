# Dragon Quest 1+2 SFC Randomizer

## Features
- Can adjust XP and gold gains from 50% to 500%.  (1,000 GP is the maximum)
- Can randomize gold costs in shops up to 20-500%.
- Can randomize monster zones and the princess and armor boss fight.
- Can randomize monster patterns
- Can randomize stat gains

## To Do/Wishlist
- Adjust encounter rate from 1/4 to 4x normal.
- Speed up battles just a little bit.
- Abilities and monsters "cross game".  (Meaning big slugs, the defeat spell, or the Thunder Sword would exist in DQ1)
